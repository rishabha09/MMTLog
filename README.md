# MMTLog

How to provide inputs to run the application successfully

At first line you have to provide file path without in quotes.
eg : /home/delhivery/MMTLog/src/main/java/com/example/MMTLog/Input.text

At second line provide the keys name can be present in json file.
eg: pfm level step timestamp

At third line provide the values name on which we have to find occurrence on single value.
I am taking multiplue values in input.
eg: DESKTOP DEBUG
result would be
DESKTOP 4 
DEBUG 4

At forth line provide the input to find occurence on multiple values.
eg: DESKTOP and DEBUG
eg: DESKTOP or DEBUG
